# experience-day-2023
 
Welcome to an [Applicant Experience Day](https://www.port.ac.uk/student-life/help-and-advice/getting-your-offers-and-results/applicant-experience-days) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/).

> This hands-on session, run by academic staff from the Creative Computing team, will ask you to design a computational solution to a real-world creative problem. Working together, we will review various approaches using both hardware and software before finalising a simple functional prototype. We are aware that applicants have diverse backgrounds and prior knowledge; no experience with specific platforms or languages is necessary, and templates and examples will be provided.
